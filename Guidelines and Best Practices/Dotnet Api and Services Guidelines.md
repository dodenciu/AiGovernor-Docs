## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for endpoints, methods, and parameters.
- Follow the PascalCase naming convention for classes and methods.
- Use camelCase for method parameters, variables, and JSON properties.
- Prefix interfaces with an "I" (e.g., `IFooService`).

## 2. Versioning
- Include the API version in the route (e.g., `/api/v1/resource`).
- Consider using API versioning mechanisms provided by .NET Core.

## 3. Endpoints and Routes
- Follow RESTful principles for designing endpoints.
- Use plural nouns for resource names (e.g., `/api/products`, not `/api/product`).
- Keep routes concise, meaningful, and easy to understand.

## 4. Request and Response Formats
- Use consistent request and response formats (e.g., JSON) throughout the API.
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes for responses (e.g., 200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found).
- Include pagination, filtering, and sorting options for large collections.

## 5. Error Handling
- Return meaningful error messages in the response body for error situations.
- Use standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of an API request.
- Log errors and exceptions for debugging and monitoring.

## 6. Security
- Implement HTTPS for secure data transmission.
- Protect against common security vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection).
- Use OAuth or JWT for secure authentication and authorization.

## 7. Authentication and Authorization
- Implement role-based or claims-based authorization.
- Ensure users are properly authenticated before allowing access to specific endpoints.

## 8. Logging
- Log important events, errors, and API usage.
- Use structured logging for easy analysis and monitoring.

## 9. Testing
- Write unit tests for domain and services.
- Use xUnit testing framework.

## 10. Performance
- Optimize database queries for efficiency.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data.
- Consider load balancing and scaling for high-traffic APIs.
